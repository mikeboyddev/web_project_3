              extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history and
              majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be
              sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you

              You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense
              to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best
              outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails
              from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham,
              and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet
              dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by
              while passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also
              better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

              Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,”
              although it can be from time to time, is another town worth
              passing through for several different reasons. While it might be
